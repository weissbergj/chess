1. Although it is an older assignment, I am proud of the assign2 clock.c module. 
The current version with the extension is less beautiful, but the initial version was 
incredibly concise. It is the first assing2 tag and did not display the flashing “done.” 
I excluded it for brevity and because it is easy to display. The initial version was well 
under 100 lines (maybe 50?). Unfortunately, the extension is now 247 LOC. It was not code golf, 
but there is something to writing concisely (Romeo and Juliet Act 3, Scene 2, lines 23-27; the 
aesthetic quality of utilitarian language rather than each being at odds with one another). I 
am also proud of these functions from assign6 gl.c since they ran so efficiently without floating 
point operations! These required an adaptation of DDA and other algorithms. The assignment had no 
bugs. It passed all staff tests on the first attempt.

2. I would rewrite the assign5 shell.c module, specifically command handling and input processing 
sections (shell_readline from lines 318 to 414). The current implementation handles input reading, 
command completion, and history navigation in a single function. This is difficult to maintain and 
extend. I also mix both input reading and command processing, violating the single responsibility 
principle. I would break down shell_readline into more focused functions: (1) reading input, (2) handling 
special key events, (3) command completion, (4) managing command history, etc. I would also implement a 
state machine for clearer transitions between the three functions of the program. Furthermore, the current 
implementation has minimal error handling and uses fixed-size buffers. I should, at a minimum, incorporate 
error handline and then potentially dynamic memory allocation.

Advantages included maintainability of smaller, well-defined functions that are easier to read and test, 
extensibility by separating functions and adding new features, performance by optimizing memory management, 
and error management. 

Here is a conceptual example of how the code might look:
// src/mycode/assign5/shell.c


typedef struct {
    char input_buffer[MAX_LINE_LENGTH];
    size_t cursor_position;
    size_t input_length;
    int history_index;
} InputState;


void shell_readline(char buf[], size_t bufsize) {
    InputState input_state = initialize_input_state();


    while (1) {
        char ch = shell_state.read_input();


        if (process_input_character(ch, &input_state, buf)) {
            return; // Input finalized
        }
    }
}


static InputState initialize_input_state() {
    InputState state;
    state.cursor_position = 0;
    state.input_length = 0;
    state.history_index = 0;
    memset(state.input_buffer, 0, MAX_LINE_LENGTH);
    return state;
}


static bool process_input_character(char ch, InputState *state, char buf[]) {
    if (handle_special_keys(ch, state)) {
        return false; // Continue reading input
    }


    if (is_end_of_input(ch)) {
        finalize_input(state, buf);
        return true; // Input finalized
    }


    if (ch == '\b') {
        delete_char(state);
        return false; // Continue reading input
    }


    if (is_valid_character(ch)) {
        insert_char(ch, state);
    }


    return false; // Continue reading input
}


static bool handle_special_keys(char ch, InputState *state) {
    switch (ch) {
        case PS2_KEY_ARROW_LEFT:
            move_cursor_left(state);
            return true;
        case PS2_KEY_ARROW_RIGHT:
            move_cursor_right(state);
            return true;
        case PS2_KEY_ARROW_UP:
            navigate_history_up(state);
            return true;
        case PS2_KEY_ARROW_DOWN:
            navigate_history_down(state);
            return true;
        case '\t':
            complete_command(state);
            return true;
        default:
            return false; // Not a special key
    }
}


static bool is_end_of_input(char ch) {
    return ch == '\n' || ch == '\r';
}


static void finalize_input(InputState *state, char buf[]) {
    shell_state.shell_printf("\n");
    state->input_buffer[state->input_length] = '\0';
    memcpy(buf, state->input_buffer, state->input_length + 1);
    if (state->input_length > 0) {
        add_to_history(buf);
    }
}


static bool is_valid_character(char ch) {
    return ch >= ' ' && ch < 0x7f && shell_state.input_length < MAX_LINE_LENGTH - 1;
}


static void move_cursor_left(InputState *state) {
    if (state->cursor_position > 0) {
        state->cursor_position--;
        shell_state.shell_printf("\b");
    } else {
        shell_bell();
    }
}


static void move_cursor_right(InputState *state) {
    if (state->cursor_position < state->input_length) {
        state->cursor_position++;
        shell_state.shell_printf("\x1b[C");
    } else {
        shell_bell();
    }
}


static void navigate_history_up(InputState *state) {
    if (state->history_index < shell_state.history_size) {
        state->history_index++;
        show_history_entry(state->history_index - 1);
    } else {
        shell_bell();
    }
}


static void navigate_history_down(InputState *state) {
    if (state->history_index > 0) {

3. See the letter below.

Dear Prospective 107e Students,

This is a general letter about computer science at Stanford, 107e versus 107, style, and life choices. 
I hope it helps you on your programming journey.

If you are familiar with 107’s content—program execution, C programming, data representation, memory 
management, and performance optimization—107 requires less minimal effort. 107 is declarative, while 
107e is procedural. Neither are theoretical. Generally, it is more interesting to learn how to work in 
bare metal environments. Neither is more time-consuming nor easier with average effort, but both can be 
done with minimal or maximal effort.

If you are worried about not having done 106b or even written code in the past, you will be fine as long 
as you have been exposed to a rigorous treatment of any logical subject (e.g., math, physics, chemistry). 
Take 107e over 161 (Google algorithms when needed), 103 (high school math), and 109 (high school statistics).

Per style, code is logic. Write code as you think about problems. Worry about writing beautiful code 
rather than about style, although you may not care enough to take the time for that in all assignments—I 
cared especially for a select few—so just make it efficient. See Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. 
There are some principles in advanced algorithm design (particularly games) and when working with lengthy, 
complex code bases, but those are not relevant.

My ultimate advice is thus: treat programming (not “computer science”) as an art and intellectual 
interest rather than a ticket to a software engineering position; focus on courses that treat 
programming as such; this is one of the few core classes that attempts to do so. Approach all of 
Stanford with this mindset.

Best,

A Former 107e Student

P.S. As additional advice, consider CS 242, CS 336, Math 230, Stats 300 (although niche), and other 
paper-reading classes over 229, 231N, 224N, etc. Prerequisites are not needed.

# Wizardâ€™s Chess

## Team members
Zara and Jared

## Project goals
We will design a custom chess algorithm that a user can play over the internet. We hope to integrate this with an electromagnetic board that automatically moves pieces. The latter is our quasi-reach feature. The overall learning goals are the following:

## Learning goals
- Design of efficient algorithms
- Precise hardware control and movement
- Networking
- Potential Mango-Pi interaction

## Resources, budget
We will source materials from Amazon and other websites. This weekend will be spent designing the mechanical components of our project and determining exactly what parts we need to purchase versus designing ourselves (3D printing, CAD).

## Tasks, member responsibilities
Zara and Jared will be responsible for both parts of the project. However, Jared will spend more time on the software implementation, while Zara will spend time on the hardware.

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
We assess the feasibility of the project with a rudimentary implementation of chess. Then, we make this implementation significantly more robust and host it online. The checkpoint for online chess will be following Thanksgiving break. This will be ready for the December lab. At that point, we should have all parts ready to implement the board and a backup software program to rely on.
